# career-planner-rpg

A desktop and mobile application that helps individuals with their career planning, with a similar look and feel to an MMORPG like World of Warcraft. Individuals would create characters, showcase their growth by improving levels in certain skills pertinent to their role, be able to visualize how similar individuals have charted a course forward, get access to learning and development resources, and eventually plan how they would like to proceed in their career.
